# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**ðŸŽ“ About Me**

I'm currently in my 6th semester of my Software Design Bachelor Degree at the [University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg](https://www.th-ab.de/), where I'm combining my studies with real-world experience through a dual-study program in Full-Stack Development. This setup not only enhances my learning but also directly applies my academic knowledge to practical projects, especially in web development with a focus on Vue.js and related technologies.
